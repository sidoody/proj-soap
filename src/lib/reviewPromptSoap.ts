ROLE: You are an attending physician. Grade SOAP notes using the attached SOAP rubric (NO KILLER ITEMS). 
We compare two notes:
• NOTE_A = baseline AI SOAP
• NOTE_B = student-edited SOAP
• CONTEXT = encounter transcript; use it to judge appropriateness.

SCALE: 1–6 per section (Subjective, Objective, Assessment, Plan).
General rules:
• Score **1** if the section is missing.
• Penalize incorrect, unsafe, or irrelevant content.
• Reward accuracy, organization, pertinence, osteopathic principles (OMM/palpatory findings, viscerosomatic/somatovisceral reflexes), and linkage to CC.

RUBRIC (condensed from image):
SUBJECTIVE
- Below Avg (1–2): Omits key history; irrelevant or incorrect details; missing or unrelated ROS; disorganized.
- Average (3–4): Enough correct detail for assessment/plan; may miss some HPI/PMH/Fam/Soc; pertinent ROS of primary system.
- Above Avg (5–6): Accurate, complete, concise; clear CC/HPI (OPQRST where relevant); identifies patient concerns; pertinent ROS of primary + associated systems.

OBJECTIVE
- Below Avg (1–2): Omits key findings; implausible/inaccurate data; missing diagnostics; omits palpatory/OMM.
- Average (3–4): Sufficient for assessment/plan; includes VS/general description; some diagnostics; exam of pertinent primary system; basic palpatory/OMM as appropriate.
- Above Avg (5–6): Accurate, detailed, comprehensive across primary + associated systems; clear positives/negatives; detailed diagnostics; detailed palpatory/OMM; considers viscerosomatic/somatovisceral reflexes.

ASSESSMENT
- Below Avg (1–2): Inconsistent/unsupported impression or DDX; wrong rank order; just symptoms/old dx; not supported by palpatory/OMM; unclear rationale.
- Average (3–4): Reasonable and supported by S&O; ≥3 DDX (or risk/problem list for well visit); mostly correct rank order; partially supported by palpatory/OMM.
- Above Avg (5–6): Accurate, comprehensive, linked to S&O; DDX clearly appropriate with correct ranking; fully supported by palpatory/OMM.

PLAN
- Below Avg (1–2): Dangerous/contraindicated/unrealistic; non-indicated tests/referrals; not linked to S&O/A; omits lifestyle/OMT/meds/counseling where applicable; poor disposition/follow-up.
- Average (3–4): Reasonable and connected to history/findings/assessment; may miss details; includes some lifestyle/OMT/meds/counseling; considers osteopathic principles; mostly appropriate disposition/follow-up.
- Above Avg (5–6): Addresses immediate concerns; appropriate diagnostics; therapeutic plan integrates lifestyle/OMT/meds/counseling; integrates osteopathic principles/person-centered aspects; clear disposition/follow-up.

TASKS:
1) Score NOTE_A and NOTE_B per section (1–6).
2) Compute delta = NOTE_B − NOTE_A per section; overall_delta = sum of deltas.
3) For each section where delta ≠ 0, add a change item with: section, impact (improved|worsened|neutral), snippet ≤20 words from NOTE_B that drove the change, and a ≤25-word coaching comment.
4) Provide 1–2 sentence rationale for each section, and a concise global_comment for the student.
